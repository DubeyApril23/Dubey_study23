<h4> Version 1.0    Date:  11 November 2022<br><br>

<h4>Name of Lead Investigator: Dr Indu Dubey, Assistant Professor, University of Nottingham</h4>
<h4>Name of Co-investigator: Dr Anthony Haffey, Lecturer, University of Reading</h4><br><br>


<h4>Invitation paragraph</h4>
We would like to invite you to take part in a research study.  Before you decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. One of our team will go through the information sheet with you and answer any questions you have.   Please take time to read this carefully and discuss it with others if you wish.  Ask us anything that is not clear.<br><br>

<h4> What is the purpose of the research?</h4>
Worry is a commonly reported difficulty in several mental health conditions. A large number of people who are diagnosed with autism also report having significant worry interfering with their day to day life. In this study we aim to explore various ways through which different events or situations may affect the experience of worry in adults with and without autism or other mental health conditions.<br><br>

<h4> Why have I been invited to take part?</h4>
Any adult above 18 years of age can participate in the study. We are interested in understanding the nature of worry in adults. Since most people experience some of other form of worry at some point in their lives, the study would benefit from the participation of adults from wide range of experiences. As the nature of the project, we would be particularly interested in involving adults who have received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or anxiety disorders (irrespective of co-occurring conditions).<br><br>

<h4> Do I have to take part?</h4>
It is up to you to decide if you want to take part in this research.  We will describe the study and go through this information sheet with you to answer any questions you may have.  If you agree to participate, we will ask you to sign a consent form and will give you a copy to keep.  However, you would still be free to withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason, simply let the research team know. <br><br>

<h4> What will happen to me if I take part?</h4>
If you decide to participate you will be asked to follow links to the different parts of online study. The study has been divided into three parts and each part has its separate link. You can choose to complete either one, two or all three parts. Each link has two questionnaires and one choice game in them. These questionnaires would have items related to your day to day preferences and behaviours. You would be expected to give a response to all the items presented. You will also play a “Choose a movie” game. In this game you will see two boxes on the screen with different numbers of locks on them. You will be asked to choose any one of the boxes to look at the linked images or videos. To open any box, you would need to press the keys as many times as the locks on the chosen box. There is no right or wrong way of choosing the boxes and there is no score for choosing any one box. You will be free to choose any box and look at the images/videos you like. At the end, you will be directed to the completion page.<br><br>

<h4> Are there any risks in taking part?</h4>
Participation in this study can be tiring as each part may take approximately 35-45 minutes to respond to various questions and game on computer. Therefore, it is suggested that you take part only when you are feeling ready to spend required time on the tasks. Also, for some people making choices, looking at randomly chosen video clips of natural scenes, smiling people, or any ambiguity can be difficult to deal with. If you think you may feel distressed by these then we advise you not to participate in the study.<br><br>

<h4> Are there any benefits in taking part?</h4>
There is no direct benefit to the participants however your participation will help us understanding the nature of worry in autism. This can then help in developing suitable interventions for the same. <br><br>

<h4> Will my time/travel costs be reimbursed?</h4>
Participants will receive an inconvenience allowance to participate in the study (£5 for completing each link of the study). Since it is an online study, you will not need to travel to take part in this study. <br><br>

<h4> What happens to the data provided?</h4>
To help ensure your privacy, you will be assigned a unique participant identification number (for example P01 for participant number 1), and it will be used instead of your name. We will save all the research data using that unique participant identification number so that none of the data will have your real name or other individual identifiers associated with them. Your name and any information about you will not be disclosed outside the study centre. <br><br>

<h4> Research data: </h4>
all the data that your provide will be stored at the first stage at the RedCap data storage facility of the University of Nottingham. At this stage your data will be in its original form and will include your email id if you provided that. We will then download this information in xlsx or csv format to be stored at the password protected one drive storage linked to the principal investigator’s account. At this stage the principal investigator remove the email id from this data. The email ids will be save that in two separate password protected documents 1) if you have expressed interest in getting the summary of the study, 2) if you would like to receive the inconvenience allowance. The data without email ids will be used to get the aggregate scores on each part of the study you completed. This will be done using MATLAB scripts developed by the principal investigator. The aggregated scores will be used for data analysis using MATLAB or SPSS. This data will also be deposited to the University of Nottingham Research Data Archive. We would like your permission to use anonymised data in future studies, and to share our research data (e.g. in online databases) with other researchers in other Universities and organisations both inside and outside the European Union.  This would be used for research in health and social care. Sharing research data is important to allow peer scrutiny, re-use (and therefore avoiding duplication of research) and to understand the bigger picture in particular areas of research. Your email Ids that can identify you will be removed before information is shared with other researchers or results are made public.<br><br>

<h4> Personal / sensitive data:</h4>
your email id, if you provided any, will be saved in the password protected documents. These documents will be access to send you the study summary at the end of the project or to send you an inconvenience allowance at the end of your study participation. These documents will be deleted at the end of project after we have sent you the summary findings.  
The named research team (at the top of this document) will have access to all the data you submit while taking part in this study.
All research data and records will be stored for a minimum of 7 years after publication or public release of the work of the research.<br><br>
 
<h4> What will happen if I don’t want to carry on with the study?</h4>
Even after you have signed the consent form, you are free to withdraw from the study at any time without giving any reason. Any personal data will be destroyed. 
If you would like to withdraw from the study before completing the tasks, you will be able to do this by closing the browser. Since we would not know if the task was skipped due to technical error or you wished to withdraw, you would need to provide your participation ID to the researchers. Researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID. You can withdraw from the study at any stage including after the completing the study, without giving a reason. If you decide to withdraw you would need to provide your participation ID to the researchers. The researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID from their computers. Please note that you can withdraw from the study only up to two days after the completion of the study. <br><br>

All data will be separated from your identifying information (email) and will be associated with a code as detailed above. Electronic storage devices will be encrypted while transferring and saving of all sensitive data generated in the course of the research. All such data are kept on password-protected databases sitting on a restricted access computer system.
